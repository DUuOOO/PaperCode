## SeqRFM
This repo hosts the code for paper **"Yanxin Zheng, Wensheng Gan, Zefeng Chen, Pinlyu Zhouï¼Œ Xiangxiao Diao, and Philippe Fourier-Viger: SeqRFM: Fast RFM Analysis in Sequence Data Submitted to Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS), pp 1-18 (2023)."**

## Requirements
Java programming language.

## Running the program
A simple way is to run MainTestSeqRFM.java or MainTestMSeqRFM.java.

## Benchmarks
- The data format used is the same as in the file test_dataset.txt. That is, different positive integers represent different terms. In addition, "-1" is used as the itemset separator and "-2" is used as the sequence separator. The monetary value and timestamp associated with an item appear within '[]' and '()' respectively.
- Additional datasets used in the paper can be accessed from the branch of datasets.
